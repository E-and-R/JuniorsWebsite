My first impression when I met Junior, was that of a man who carries his duties quietly but efficiently. Although he is much younger than me and considers me as his mentor, I can say with no shadow of doubt that he  challenges me to grow both professionally and personally. This speaks a lot about his intentional investment in growing holistically as an individual.\nAs an aspiring computer scientist, he has always shown a strong desire to find more ways of doing things efficiently. In the world of so many things to do in a little time, perhaps this is one of the most important skills that is essential for survival.\nHold on, there is still more. His love for life-long learning especially for aspects/subjects that are not necessarily in the computer science field is what often makes me look forward to the near future to see how unique and excellent this computer scientist will be. It is of no doubt that the world is headed towards multi-field approach of solving the challenges we have. Outstanding personnel in their respective fields will need a bit of the knowledge of everything. Junior Moraba has been intentionally setting himself up for that beyond his university degree curriculum, perhaps without even noticing.\nDid I mention that his great interpersonal skills is treasure to be treasured? I have confidence that whoever he chooses to work with or for in the near future will benefit from greatly this skill of his."}  />
